* Thoughts
** Potential inference & reasoning additions

*** IDEA: Forward chaining inference

Forward-chaining reasoner that complements the existing production rules system that would maintain a more explicit agenda and conflict resolution strategy. RETE-like?

*** IDEA: Backward chaining query planner

Goal-driven reasoning system that integrates with the existing datalog impl?

*** IDEA: Truth maintenance system (TMS)

Justification / assumption-based truth maintenance. Track dependencies between derived facts and supporting evidence, enabling belief revision when assumptions are retracted. Natural fit with the EAV tuple architecture.

*** IDEA: Inductive logic programming

Build on the version spaces implementation to learn logic rules from examples. Given positive/negative examples in EAV form, induce production rules or Datalog rules that explain the data.

*** IDEA: Probabilistic reasoning with Bayesian networks

Belief propagation over networks of dependencies. Nodes would be LVars with probability distributions. Could represent network structure in EAV tuples with edges as :bn/parent relations.

*** IDEA: Analogical reasoning

   Create structure mapping between knowledge bases. Given two KB domains, find analogous relations and transfer knowledge between them. Based on structure-mapping theory (L@@k Gentner).

*** IDEA: Constraint propagation algorithms

Current constraint solver with arc-consistency (AC-3), forward checking, and backjumping. Maybe integrate with the production system for constraint satisfaction problems.

*** IDEA: Case-based reasoning (CBR)

Store problem-solution pairs as entities in EAV. Implement retrieval by similarity (using search protos), adaptation of solutions to new problems, learning. Soundex could support fuzzy matching?

*** IDEA: Explanation-based generalization (EBG)

Given a specific problem solution and domain theory, extract general rules. Complements version spaces by using causal explanations rather than just empirical data. Datalog rules as the domain theory?

*** IDEA: Temporal reasoning capabilities

L@@k Allen's interval algebra or point-based temporal logic. Represent time intervals/points as entities with temporal relations. Query across time?

*** IDEA: Abductive reasoning capability

Hypothesis generation from observations. Given observations (EAV tuples) and a KB with causal rules, generate minimal explanations. Complements the deductive datalog and inductive version spaces.

*** IDEA: Fuzzy logic reasoning

Fuzzy set membership functions and fuzzy rule evaluation. Extend LVars to support fuzzy values (degree of membership). Fuzzy versions of datalog queries with approximate matching and aggregation operators.

*** IDEA: Nonmonotonic reasoning

Default logic or circumscription for reasoning with incomplete information. Add :default/rule attribute type to represent defeasible rules. Common-sense reasoning where conclusions can be retracted with new evidence?

** Potential changes to what's here

*** IDEA: Incremental query evaluation

Materialized views of datalog queries that update efficiently when the KB changes. Could cache query results and use differential dataflow techniques to maintain them as facts are added/removed.

*** IDEA: Create visual debugger for production rule firing

Jess-like visualize rule conflict sets, and inspect bindings at each step.

*** IDEA: Probabilistic version spaces

Maintain probability distributions over hypotheses rather than just boundary sets. Enables softer classification and confidence estimates.

** Research

*** Explore connection between amb and version spaces
   
Both do search through possibility spaces. Could amb be used to implement version space learning? Or could version spaces guide amb exploration?

*** Integration with spec for type constraints
   
Use clojure.spec to define domains for LVars, validate KB consistency, generate test data. Could constraint solver use spec predicates directly?

** Documentation & Testing

*** Property-based testing with test.check
   
Generate random KBs, queries, rules and verify algebraic properties hold.

*** Document theoretical foundations
   
Explain the algorithms and ideas behind each module. Help users understand when to apply each technique and what guarantees they provide.

** Integration ideas

*** Version spaces + Datalog: concept learning with background knowledge

Use Datalog rules as background theory to guide version space generalization. When generalizing, only consider generalizations that are consistent with domain rules.

*** Constraints + Production rules: reactive constraint satisfaction

Use production rules to propagate constraint changes. When a variable is bound, fire rules that further constrain related variables.

*** Search + Production rules: heuristic problem solving

Use A* to guide production rule firing. Instead of naive conflict resolution, estimate utility of firing each rule and pursue most promising first.

*** amb + Constraints: backtracking constraint satisfaction

Use amb to explore the space of variable assignments, with constraint checks as acceptance tests. amb handles backtracking, constraints prune search space.

** Post ideas

*** The Unreasonable Effectiveness of EAV

Why entity-attribute-value representation is so versatile. Compare to other knowledge representations (frames, objects, graphs, tables).

*** Nondeterministic Programming in Clojure

McCarthy's amb operator and its implementation. Express search problems declaratively. Compare to Prolog, core.logic, and explicit backtracking.
